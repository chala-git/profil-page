    "text": "Bio\nI am a 1st year PhD candidate at Laboratoire Navier - École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées and TotalEnergies, working at the intersection of generative modeling and geosciences under the supervision of Jean-Michel Pereira, Lina Guayacan, David Picard, Leon Barens and Lionel Boillot. My research focuses on stochastic interpolation techniques for subsurface data, with applications in soil characterization for offshore wind farms.\nPrior to my PhD, I worked as a research engineer at TotalEnergies, where I developed machine learning methods for seismic and well log data analysis and defined my PhD project.\nI hold a Master in Applied Mathematics from Université Grenoble Alpes and an engineering degree from Grenoble INP – Ensimag, with a focus in machine learning, statistical modeling, and optimization. My academic journey also includes a research internship at the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo, where I explored multimodal context analysis for live video comment generation."
